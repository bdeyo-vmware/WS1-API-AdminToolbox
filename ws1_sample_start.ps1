    Clear Powershell $error Logging. This is most useful for debugging purposes as only the errors from the previous script will show up.
        Of course you must press ctrl+c to exit before they are cleared.

        This entire thing be discarded. It would be much cleaner to have a start-ws1ToolBox cmdlet, that imports the modules and automatically launches the select-ws1config cmdlet

$error.clear()
